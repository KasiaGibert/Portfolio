## About me
Hello! I'm Kasia Gibert, and I recently earned my postgraduate degree in Software Testing at WSB University. I am dedicated to enhancing my skills in ISTQB and software testing and I am currently focused on learning Postman Rest API, SQL, and Selenium with Python. My ultimate aspiration is to become an automation tester, and I am eagerly seeking new career opportunities in the field of Software Testing.

As a professional and a communicative person, I pride myself on being a team player and can easily adapt to both fast-paced and laid-back work environments. My commitment to continuous growth in this field motivates me to share my experiences and knowledge, as I am determined to demonstrate the skills I have acquired and further develop in the realm of software testing.
