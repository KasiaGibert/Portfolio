## About me
Hey! My name is Kasia Gibert. I have recently completed postgraduate degree in Software Tester at WSB University. I am constantly improving my skills related to ISTQB and software testing, and currently studying Postman Rest API, SQL and Selenium with Python. My goal for the future is to develop into an automation tester. I am ready for new career opportunities as a Software Tester. I am a team player, and can adapt quickly to a fast-paced work environment or a more laid-back one as required. I will be sharing my experience, because I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field.
